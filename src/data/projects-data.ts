    overview:
      'A freelance volunteer project built on WordPress to showcase independent YouTube journalists across multiple countries. Each page groups channels by topic—Science and Geopolitics—and includes QR code donation options alongside direct YouTube links. The entire site was built using custom HTML blocks within the Gutenberg editor, with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and responsive design.',

    challenges:
      'The biggest challenge was the lack of clear assets and direction from the client at the start of the project. Without defined visual materials or specific requirements, I had to proactively design and share multiple layout drafts to help identify the right concept. After receiving approval on the chosen style, I continued to develop each page and incorporated feedback iteratively, ensuring the result aligned with the client’s evolving expectations.',

      'This project sharpened my front-end design skills and deepened my understanding of how to use WordPress as a flexible CMS with minimal reliance on plugins. I also learned how to structure and scale multi-page static content effectively—entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside WordPress.Beyond the technical growth, it was personally rewarding to support independent journalism through volunteer work. Managing client feedback cycles and simplifying backend tasks for non-technical users helped me grow as both a developer and communicator.',

We relied heavily on documentation, YouTube tutorials, and self-directed learning to overcome technical gaps throughout development.',

If given the chance, I would love to deploy the app in the future to expand its availability to other regions.',

These errors led to a longer debugging process than expected. However, now that I’m more familiar with the tool, I expect future implementations to be much faster and more efficient.</br></br>Another challenge was ensuring that relational schemas worked properly with Strapi and Neon PostgreSQL. Although the database relationships were correctly set up, I discovered that Strapi also requires explicit permission settings between related tables. Without carefully configuring these settings, the client could encounter errors when managing content. To prevent this, I double-checked all role and permission configurations to ensure a smooth CMS experience.',
